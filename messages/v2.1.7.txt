Sublemacs Pro v2.1.7 Update
=============================

I-Search

    Fixed a bug where using the previous search string would fail.

    Added support for remembering previous searches. You can access previous searches with the up and
    down arrow keys after you initiate a search.

New: Switch to View Command

    Implemented a better version of emacs "switch-to-buffer" which sorts the views by last used time, so
    that you get the same experience as regular emacs. Also the top two views are switched so you can
    easily switch back and forth between them:

        {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "b"], "command": "sbp_switch_to_view"},

    for the original emacs key binding.

    There are optional arguments completion_components=2 and display_components=1 and they both
    specify the number of components of the view's file name that are displayed. The default
    configuration displays displays the view's file name and parent directory (the last 2 components
    of the file path) on the top line and just the last component of the file name on the second
    line. The completion is performed on the first line. If you set the value of display_components
    to 0, the second line will be omitted entirely.

New: All View Auto Complete

    I have been using the All Autocomplete plugin for a while but occasionally couldn't understand why
    strings were not being found. I discovered that there are two reasons: one is it has a built-in
    limit of 20 views to search, and the other was that there are issues with some syntaxes which
    prevent some symbols from being found. The issues with specific syntaxes can be considered bugs with
    those syntaxes, but it doesn't help since I am not going to fix those syntaxes. So I have fixed both
    those problems to the best of my ability by writing my own completion.

    It is disabled by default.

    To enable it, add the following plugin setting:

        "sbp_use_internal_complete_all_buffers": true,

Fix: Quit Command (ctrl+g)

    The ctrl+g command was dismissing popups and panels AND disabling multi-cursors at the same
    time, so it was not possible to just dismiss a popup without losing your cursors.

    The command now also takes an optional parameter favor_side="start". This is used when there are
    multiple cursors or a large selection. The possible values are "start" and "end" and it
    specifies which side of the selection to use. In the case of multi-cursors, it means the first
    or last cursor.

    If the start AND the end of the current selection or the set of cursors is NOT currently
    visible, the plugin automatically chooses the end closest to the current view.

New: Close Current View

    This command bound closes the current view but then selects the most recently used view (like
    emacs) rather than one of the adjacent views.

New: Close Older Views Commands

    Now that this plugin keeps track of the last used time for views, it's possible to close the N
    least recently used views. This is a good way to trim the current number of views if you feel
    like things are getting out of hand.

    Here is the default binding:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "K"], "command": "sbp_close_older_views", "args": {"n_windows": 5}},

Improve: Choose and Yank Command

    The choose and yank command now does a better job of picking the sample text from each kill so
    that they display better especially when the text is wider than your window.

    Also this command pulls in the external clipboard before showing you the choices. It used to be
    the case that only the yank command pulled in the external clipboard.

    Here is the default bindings:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "ctrl+y"], "command": "sbp_choose_and_yank"},

Improve: Move To Paragraph Command

    This command has been improved in the way it moves over paragraphs.

    It is also now multi-cursor aware.

    WARNING: The direction argument was reversed from what it was supposed to be so if you have your
    own bindings for this command you will have to change direction=1 to direction=-1 and vice
    versa.

New: Jump to Char/String and Zap to Char/String Commands

    These try to mimic the emacs jump and zap commands. Our implementation is multi-cursor aware. An
    optional argument decides whether the character your jump to is included (e.g., jumped over) or
    not. The same applies for the zap commands.

    Here are the default bindings:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "j", "c"], "command": "sbp_jump_to_char", "args": {"include_char": true}},
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "j", "C"], "command": "sbp_jump_to_char", "args": {"include_char": false}},
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "j", "s"], "command": "sbp_jump_to_string", "args": {"include_string": true}},
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "j", "S"], "command": "sbp_jump_to_string", "args": {"include_string": false}},
    {"keys": ["alt+z"], "command": "sbp_zap_to_char", "args": {"include_char": true},
        "context": [{"key": "sbp_use_alt_bindings"}]
    },
    {"keys": ["shift+alt+z"], "command": "sbp_zap_to_char", "args": {"include_char": false},
        "context": [{"key": "sbp_use_alt_bindings"}]
    },
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "z"], "command": "sbp_zap_to_string", "args": {"include_char": true}},
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "Z"], "command": "sbp_zap_to_string", "args": {"include_char": false}},

New: Choose and Yank Register Command

    There is now a choose and yank feature for text registers that mirrors the choose and yank
    command for the kill ring.

    Here are the default bindings:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "r", "r"], "command": "sbp_choose_and_yank_register"},

New: Choose and Yank Point Command

    There is now a choose and yank feature for point registers that mirrors the choose and yank
    command for the kill ring.

    Here are the default bindings:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "r", "p"], "command": "sbp_choose_and_yank_point"},

Fix: Upper/Lower Case Region Command

    The C-X C-L/C-U commands to perform upper and lower case changes to the emacs region(s) were not
    working at all. They are all based on the same command, where you specify arguments for the case
    change (e.g., mode="upper", mode="lower") and whether we're required to operate on a region
    (use_region="true"). When use_region is true, there must be a visible selection or selections,
    OR, there must be an emacs region or regions (e.g., a region defined by mark and point).

    The name of the command has changed so if you have your own bindings the new command name and
    default bindings are:

    {"keys": ["alt+c"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"direction": 1, "mode": "title"},
        "context": [ {"key": "sbp_use_alt_bindings"}]
    },

    {"keys": ["alt+u"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"direction": 1, "mode": "upper"},
        "context": [ {"key": "sbp_use_alt_bindings"}]
    },
    {"keys": ["alt+l"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"direction": 1, "mode": "lower"},
        "context": [ {"key": "sbp_use_alt_bindings"}]
    },

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "ctrl+u"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"mode": "upper", "use_region": true}},
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "ctrl+l"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"mode": "lower", "use_region": true}},

New: Convert Between camelCase and Underscores

    The command to perform upper and lower case changes for regions described above also
    includes a (mode="camel") which converts from underscores to camelCase and
    (mode="underscore") which converts from camelCase to underscores.

    The default bindings are shown below:

    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "ctrl+super+u"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"mode": "underscore", "use_region": true}},
    {"keys": ["ctrl+x", "ctrl+super+c"], "command": "sbp_change_case", "args": {"mode": "camel", "use_region": true}},
